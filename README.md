# React + TypeScript + Vite

# TODO

- Clean up UI.
- Make sure this all works with no data.
- Look into SDXL sporadically tagging innocent prompts as NSFW.
- Fix the voting code for when the same parameter is in both samples.
- I get a `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'prompt')` when voting in production, at least when there's only one prompt.
